# LaPipette-App
Simple prototype app for displaying LaPipette's work

## Structure
I have set a GitHub-repository, where I uploaded your designed vaccinine detial cards [link](https://github.com/KuechlerO/LaPipette-VaccineCards), and the app fetches the cards dynamically from that resource. 
This way, we can ensure the up-to-date quality of the displayed info-cards, regardless which app-version is installed. 

Currently the app is very simple.
But there is plenty of space to add additional features like 
- language settings, 
- add detial/paper-links to each info-card, 
- add further areas to display your creative work,
- add links to your social media canals

## Installation
You can find a up-to-date APK-file in my Github-repo [here](https://github.com/KuechlerO/LaPipette-App/tree/main/app/release), which you can directly install on your Android-device.
